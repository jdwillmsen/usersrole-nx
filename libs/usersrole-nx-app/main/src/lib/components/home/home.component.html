    This is a frontend application that provides a template for users
    authentication and authorization since these are common features used in
    most applications. It also has additional features such as theme selection,
    snackbar service, alerts service, and a general site layout with header,
    collapsable sidebar/navigation, and main content area. This application is
    also a Progressive Web App (PWA) and can be downloaded as an app on mobile
    and desktop devices.

    The authentication is provided by Firebase with Google Identity Platform and
